Some Scintillating stuff surely must have not put attention on it.
1. if you have something to add like 12+13 or 45+46 or number consecutive in order.
Step 1.   Take the even number or digit end with 5 and double it. Because even digit and digit with the unit place as 5 is the easiest thing our mind gasp up. 
Step 2. 
12+13 =25  //  (12*2)+1=25
45+46= 91 // (45*2)+1=91
17+18= 35  //(18*2)-1=35

2. If you have to add something like 15+17 where the 1+consecutive number is there.
		You can proceed it like 15+17=32 or just take the middle digit and multiply it by 2  as16*2 =32  
So simple, isn't it?
46+48= 94  or 47*2=94.

Why its easy beascue this the power of 2. The easiest thing is to play with 2 either it may be multiple or divide it's very simple.

3. POWER OF DIGIT "9"
Ok, do what I say.
Step 1. Take any digit, make sure it is equal o greater the 2 digit number.
Step 2. Add the digit like if you chose  1245 then  1+2+4+5=12
Step 3. Subtract the original number the sum like 1245-12=1233
Step 4. Try to divide it by "9" it will always be completely divisible by 9.
Don't believe me try it yourself. Start with 10<->inifity.
